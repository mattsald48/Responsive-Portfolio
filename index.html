            <p>Since the beginning of time, the earth has been at a standstill.  All the joy, discovery, sorrow, and strife have lead up to one important moment. This culminating moment being the date of November 7, 1986. The exact time being the birth of one young man. At first glance, seemingly unremarkable in every aspect. But underlying his average appearance laid the potential to change all that had come before him.  History as we know it was only a preface to the story that was about to be unleashed.  His first cries and gasps for breath ushering in an awakening for all of humanity and perhaps the universe. This young man's name you ask?  I don't know, probably Mark.  It might even be a lady for all I know.  The important thing is that I was also born on that day as well. I'm not going to change the world but I am hoping to make some functional and visually appealing websites in a few months. Hopefully I may make someone’s day by getting them the online presence they always wanted.  As for all that other nonsense, we might just have to leave the heavy lifting to Mark.</p>

            <p>This site is my first stab at making something like this. It is a work in progress that will evolve and grow as my coding skills increase.  It will also be populated by other projects I will be creating over the coming months.</p>
